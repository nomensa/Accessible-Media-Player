/**
*    The Nomensa accessible media player is a flexible multimedia solution for websites and intranets.  
*    The core player consists of JavaScript wrapper responsible for generating an accessible HTML toolbar 
*    for interacting with a media player of your choice. We currently provide support for YouTube (default),
*    Vimeo and JWPlayer although it should be possible to integrate the player with almost any media player on
*    the web (provided a JavaScript api for the player in question is available).
